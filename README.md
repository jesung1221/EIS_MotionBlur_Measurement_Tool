This project aims to measure the effectiveness of Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) algorithms. Given a video processed with EIS, the software quantifies the degree of stabilization achieved and assesses the level of motion blur present in the footage. To simulate real-world camera shake, the camera is mounted on an oscillating machine, while a specially designed chart facilitates accurate feature matching and motion blur tracking.
